#Tic Tac Toe

Authors: Wyatt Burlingame, Jack Gauvin

Welcome to the game of tic tac toe. Our goal of this project was to recreate the tic tac toe game we created in CS150. 

Its basic tic tac toe....

You can win as Player 1


You can win as Player 2


And you can get a catscratch

The game uses a vector of win cases and checks each time a player takes their turn to see if someone won.
